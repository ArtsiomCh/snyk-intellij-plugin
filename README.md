Snyk helps you find, fix and monitor for known vulnerabilities in Node.js npm, Ruby and Java dependencies, both on an ad hoc basis and as part of your CI (Build) system.

The Snyk IntelliJ plugin is able to scan your maven-based
projects against the snyk CLI.

For this initial release, it requires you to first log in via
the [Snyk Command-Line Interface](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk)

## Installation


This plugin is published in the [IntelliJ Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10972-snyk-vulnerability-scanning)

Install via IntelliJ's built-in plugin browser. 

## Supported IntelliJ versions

The plugin requires IntelliJ 2017.3 or above.

Other Jetbrains IDEs, such as PyCharm or WebStorm are not _currently_ supported.

SBT, Gradle, and other build-systems are scheduled for a future release.
